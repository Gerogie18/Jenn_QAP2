 Second QAP fall 2024

1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

   Answer: I spent about 8.7 hours on this assignment - approx times are noted in the JS file after each function.
2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)\

   Answer:  I mostly used Meta AI to ask questions where I was stuck and to make some testing data for some of the questions, ChatGBT to find an issue with my regex (it was an issue with how I'd copied it from regex101).  I refreshed on regex with https://regexlearn.com/ and used https://regex101.com/ to test my regex.
3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the
   friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

   Answer: No, I didn't ask questions from classmates.
4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

   Answer: Yes, I asked Vanessa for clarification on throwing errors vs consoling errors, I found it a bit confusing as to why, especially for the truebool question - where in theory we were parsing a lot of data, that if there was an issue with the input we stopped the code, It made it difficult to test with arrays.  In the end it throws errors if provided undefined, or null, but will return undefined and console the error if given non-bool data such as a name.
5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

   Answer:  I really enjoyed the problemsolving nature of a lot of these excercises, and how they were written.  I feel confident in solving questions with the same techniques.
